Checkers (C++)
==============

This is my first game written in 2001-2002 to get a better understanding of
Win32 and C++ development. This project was abandoned after completing most
of the two-player mode (labeled "single player" in the application).


Playing
=======

To play the game, run the application and click "single player". You can
then play another person by taking turns moving the pieces on the board.
